## 5. Teamwork, branches and merging  

1. Each person creates a branch in the repo you created in the previous exercise. You can use `git branch yourbranchname` where you put any name you want for the new branch.

2. Switch to the new branch with `git checkout yourbranchname`

3. Create a uniquely named file. Put anything you want in it.

4. Do `git log` and `git status` to see any changes.

5. Stage and commit the file. Check again with `git log` and `git status`

6. Push your changes with `git push origin -u yourbranchname` (or with `git push -u origin HEAD` for a fast way when using the same name)

7. When everyone has done this, all do a `git pull`

8. Use `git status`, `git branch`, and `git log` to see what has happened.
