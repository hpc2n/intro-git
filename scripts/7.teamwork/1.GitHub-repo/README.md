# 1. Setting up a repository on GitHub 

In this exercise you will create a repository on GitHub and work with that. 

You will be working on the GitHub website (so you need to have signed up for an account). 

1. Create a repository (click on the + at the top right of the menu or picking "Start a new repository" on your "home screen")

2. Under "Quick setup", pick "creating a new file".

3. Name the file "README.md" (at the top, over the file editor).

4. Put some text in the file "README.md".

5. At the bottom, where it says "Commit new file" you should put a useful commit message. Then click "Commit new file"

6. Notice: the content of README.md appears at top level of the repo

7. Try creating another file in a subdirectory (create subdirectories by adding the name you want after the name of your repo, then adding a "/" and your filename).

8. Try adding a file that you have created on your computer and uploads (Add file -> Upload files)

9. Test out making edits to your files and committing them - all through the GitHub site.

10. If you put a file "README.md" in a subdirectory then it will be shown as a "description" for the directory

11. When you have made some commits, try click "commits" above the files in the repo and see a list of your commits.
