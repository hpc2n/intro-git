## 6. Teamwork, branches and merging, pull requests

1. Go to the repository on the GitHub page. Submit a pull-request from your branch to the main branch

2. The owner of the repository (the person who created it) can then accept them and click to merge them.

3. After doing so, everyone should again do a `git pull` (on the command line)

4. Use `git status`, `git branch --all`, and `git log --graph --oneline --decorate --all` to see what has happened.

**Note**: It is possible to make the main branch "protected" so it is not changed without a review from the owner. Try doing this (on GitHub).
