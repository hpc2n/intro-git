# Branches and merging 

1. Each person creates a branch with `git branch yourbranchname` where you put any name you want for the new branch. 

2. Create a uniquely named file. Put anything you want in it. 

3. Stage and commit the file. 

4. Push your changes with `git push origin -u yourbranchname`

5. When everyone has done this, all do a `git pull`

6. Use `git status`, `git branch`, and `git log` to see what has happened. 

NOTE: It is possible to make the master branch "protected" so it is not changed without a review from the owner.
